Originally, this was just a tool for finding the angles of a right triangle given the lengths of two of it's sides, written in Vue.js. Now, however, the focus has expanded to all manner of triangular tools and utilities.

Right now, there are two tools included, with at least one more to come:

## Right Triangle Angle Calculator
